# Configure input patch

The Configure input menu of Onimusha is buggy.

2 dlls are missing in Windows since Windows Vista (dimap.dll and diactfrm.dll).

These are the DirectInput Mapper DLLs.

To solve it, download this directory and run "install (run as admin) .bat" as administrator to install missing DLLs on a newer Windows.
